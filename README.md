# Rossman-Drug-Store
Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied. We are expecting six weeks of daily sales for 1,115 stores located across Germany. Reliable sales forecasts enable store managers to create effective staff schedules that increase productivity and motivation. By helping Rossmann create a robust prediction model, we will help store managers stay focused on what's most important to them, their customers and their teams.
